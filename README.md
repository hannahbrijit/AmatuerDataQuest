# AmatuerDataQuest

Welcome to the AmatuerDataQuest repository, the exciting realm of data exploration! This is your digital Indiana Jones, the Starship Enterprise of coding, the Treasure Island of datasets - all led by an amateur data scientist. 
We explore, we clean, we visualize, we model, and best of all, we have fun doing it. No data sets were harmed in the process, trust me. üôà

# About
This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebook files (ipynb), created using Google Colab, where I have embarked on quests to tame the wild beasts we know as 'datasets'. 
From cleaning these rowdy creatures to selecting the best features, from training my model dragon to visualizing data in the most beautiful (and informative!) ways, this is where it all happens. üé©üîçüêâ

# Contents
The  repository includes the files having the following actions performed on them:

Data_Cleaning: You wouldn't invite guests to a dirty house, would you? Well, models are our esteemed guests, and they deserve a tidy dataset. Here you'll find all the notebooks dedicated to data-cleaning operations.

Feature_Selection: It's a bit like picking a team for dodgeball. You need to select the right features for your model to have any chance of winning. These notebooks will show you the feature selection done on our favorite datasets.

Model_Training: Training a model is like training a puppy, minus the puppy eyes. Take a look at them.

Data_Visualization: They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so this must be the library. Here, I've worked on visualizing our data in new(or maybe old), creative ways.

# How to use
While you're browsing through these notebook files, you might be tempted to play around with them. And why shouldn't you? The data won't bite, I promise.

Here's how you can get started:

Fork the repo: Click on the 'Fork' button at the top-right corner of the page. This creates a copy of my repo in your GitHub account. This is like getting your own playground without needing to build swings and slides.

Clone the repo: Now, you need to bring this playground to your local system. Use git clone <your-repo-link> in your terminal or command prompt. This is like taking the playground home.

Open the notebooks: You can open these notebooks in your local Jupyter environment or upload them to Google Colab to view and edit.

Play around: Change the code, tweak the models, visualize new things - go wild!

# Contributing
Your suggestions, bug reports, and pull requests are welcome! Feel free to contribute, but remember, it's all fun and games until someone messes up the data cleaning. üòâ

# Contact
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me(drop a mail to hannahbrijit@gmail.com). But if you're a dataset trying to complain about being cleaned, sorry, I don't speak csv.
